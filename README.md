STUDENTO
A simple Java console application to manage student data. I built this to practice Object-Oriented Programming and working with ArrayLists.

Features
Add Students: Save name, ID, and grade.

View List: See all students currently in the system.

Search: Find a specific student by their ID.

Delete: Remove a student record from the list.

Project Structure
Student.java: The basic data model for a student.

StudentManager.java: The logic that handles the ArrayList and student operations.

Main.java: The user interface and menu loop.

How to Run
Clone the repository.

Open your terminal in the project folder.

Compile the code:

Bash
javac src/*.java
Run the application:

Bash
java -cp src Main
